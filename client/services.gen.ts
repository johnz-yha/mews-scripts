     * Get rate pricing
     * Returns prices for a given rate for a specified time interval. Prices will be returned for all service time units that the specified time interval intersects. So, for example, an interval `1st Jan 23:00 UTC - 1st Jan 23:00 UTC` will result in one price for `2nd Jan`, while Interval `1st Jan 23:00 UTC - 2nd Jan 23:00 UTC` will result in two prices for `2nd Jan` and `3rd Jan` (assuming a time unit period of "Day"). UTC timestamps must correspond to the start boundary of a time unit, e.g. 00:00 converted to UTC for a time unit of "Day". Other timestamps are not permitted. The __maximum size of time interval__ depends on the service's time unit: 367 hours if hours, 367 days if days, or 60 months if months. For more information about time units, see [Time units](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/connector-api/concepts/time-units).

     * Update rate price
     * Updates the prices for a given rate. You can make multiple price updates with one API call, and for each one specify the time interval for which the update applies, the price value and the applicable [resource category](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/connector-api/operations/resources/#resource-category). The price will be updated for all service [time units](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/connector-api/operations/services/#time-unit) that the specified time interval intersects. The price is per time unit, e.g. per day or per month. If the resource category `CategoryId` is not specified, the updated price will apply to the base price for all resource categories.
     * Note that prices are defined daily, so when the server receives the UTC interval, it first converts it to the enterprise timezone and updates the price on all dates that the interval intersects. Only root rates can be updated (the rates that have no base rate, that have `BaseRateId` set to `null`). It is not permitted to update historical prices older than specified by `EditableHistoryInterval`. Future prices may be updated up to 5 years in the future. The __maximum size of time interval__ is 100 time units or 2 years, whichever is the shorter amount of time.

     * Clear service overbooking limits

The specified conditions must be met exactly. The time interval, however, does not need to correspond to an existing service overbooking limit in the system, instead the API uses a splicing algorithm to work out how to divide up any existing service overbooking limit to meet the specified time interval. Past overbooking limits cannot be cleared outside of `OperationalEditableHistoryInterval`. Care is needed to specify `FirstTimeUnitStartUtc` and `LastTimeUnitStartUtc` in the correct format - see [Datetimes](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/connector-api/guidelines/serialization#datetimes). This operation supports [Portfolio Access Tokens](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/connector-api/concepts/multi-property/).
